# p-adic Generative Models & Hyperbolic Representation Learning

This repository explores the intersection of **$p$-adic mathematics, deep generative models (VQ-VAEs and Beta-VAEs), and Hyperbolic Representation Learning**. 

We investigate how neural networks represent and generate sequences under the $p$-adic metric (ultrametric tree spaces), and how these discrete hierarchical spaces map onto continuous hyperbolic structures (the Poincaré Disk model).

## 🔍 The Discovery: Multi-Task Regularization Scaling

A core research question we investigated was:
> *Is it more beneficial to train a p-adic generative model on a small, restricted set of primes (e.g., just $p \in \{2, 5\}$), or a broader, joint configuration of primes?*

Through systematic, controlled training experiments, we discovered that **training on more prime bases simultaneously is highly beneficial**. Rather than causing model saturation or capacity congestion, adding more bases acts as a powerful **multi-task regularizer**.

### 📊 Comparative Results (Evaluated on $p=2$ and $p=5$)

| Prime Set Config | Primes Included | VQ-VAE Accuracy ($p=5$) | Metric Alignment Loss ($p=5$) | Metric Alignment Loss ($p=2$) |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Restricted** | $[2, 5]$ | $51.70\%$ | $0.06533$ | $0.02469$ |
| **Broad-11** | $[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]$ | $59.98\%$ | $0.01887$ | $0.01207$ |
| **Broad-13** | $[2..13]$ | $64.52\%$ | $0.02559$ | $0.00947$ |
| **Broad-17** | $[2..17]$ | **$69.87\%$** | $0.02520$ | $0.01073$ |
| **Broad-19** | $[2..19]$ | $67.53\%$ | **$0.00698$** | **$0.00827$** |
| **Broad-23** | $[2..23]$ | $68.32\%$ | $0.05983$ | $0.01262$ |

### 📈 Reconstruction Performance Scaling
As the number of trained primes scales up, the digit reconstruction accuracy on the complex 5-ary tree ($p=5$) climbs from **$51.70\%$** to **$68.32\%$** (peaking at $69.87\%$ for Broad-17):

### 🌀 Latent Space Topology Scaling
Enforcing multiple tree topologies onto the same continuous latent space acts as a topological regularizer. As shown in the 6-way PCA projection comparison below, the latent space clusters become cleaner and more separated as we scale the prime set:

## 🔮 Poincaré Disk Hyperbolic Embeddings

A Poincaré disk is a model of 2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. Trees are discrete analogs of hyperbolic spaces; specifically, a $p$-ary tree can be viewed as a discretization of the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. 

We map $p$-adic digit sequences $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{d-1}$ (where $a_i \in \{0, \dots, p-1\}$) to Poincaré coordinates:
* **Hyperbolic Radius**: The depth $d$ of a digit corresponds to the radius $r = \tanh(c \cdot d)$. As $d \rightarrow \infty$, points converge to the boundary circle ($r \rightarrow 1$).
* **Angular Sectors**: The sequence of digits partitions the angular range $[0, 2\pi]$ into $p$-ary sectors. 
* **Ultrametric Isomorphism**: Two numbers are close in $p$-adic distance if they share a long common prefix, meaning their Poincaré paths stay together deep into the disk (closer to the boundary). If they differ early, they must travel back towards the origin to connect, resulting in a large hyperbolic distance.

python train_broad_p23.py
```

### 3. Generate Poincaré Disk Plots
To generate Poincaré disk plots dynamically for target primes:
```bash
python poincare_embedding.py
```
This generates plots under `plots/poincare_p<p>.png`.
